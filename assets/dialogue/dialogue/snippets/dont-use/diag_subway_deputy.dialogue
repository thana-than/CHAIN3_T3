Passenger: Detective Slater, in the flesh. 
Slater: Have we met? 
Passenger: No, but I’m a big fan. Don’t mind me, I don’t want to get in the way of your investigation.
Passenger: What are you investigating by the way? 
Slater: I don’t know yet. Let me know if you hear anything. 
Passenger: Will do, Detective! Hey, does this mean I’m deputized?  
Slater: I don’t think- 
Passenger: Wow. This is such a big moment for me. I would ask to shake your hand but I can’t remember how to move mine.  Slater: Right… Please let me know if you hear anything.
